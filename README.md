# Mission-control

This project uses two APIs to retrieve data on rocket launches and space-related news. 
I created this using vanilla js  so I could stay up to date with the latest developments in the space industry. 
By combining a these two APIs, the project allows users to easily access a wide range of information about the exciting world of space exploration.
